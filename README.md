This repository will hold explanations, documentations,examples and libraries developed for C++ From The Sky
Down.

C++ From the Sky Down is a series designed to present C++ as a high-level language and to show techniques and libraries (including some developed during this course) to use C++ as a high level language while hiding the low-level stuff.

This will use C++17 and C++20 (as they become available) features.

More explanations/documentations/examples/libraries will be added as the series progresses.
